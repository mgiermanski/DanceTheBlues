							<p>Brian started Swing Dancing in 2013 and has had the dancing bug ever since. 
							Diving head first into this new and exciting world, he started with Lindy Hop 
							and soon after fell in love with both Balboa and Blues. In 2014 Brian placed 
							2nd for Midstream Madness at the Australian Jitterbug Championships in Melbourne. 
							He joined the performance troupe in 2014 and has performed at many dance events 
							including Australia's largest Swing exchange Swing Camp Oz 2015.<br><br>
							Brian's passion is the slower dance style of Blues, where he feels he can really 
							get involved and express the music. With a thirst for all things Blues related, 
							Brian regularly travels to Blues exchanges around Australia to learn the most 
							current techniques from internationally renown Blues teachers. Brian also has his 
							finger on the pulse of the live Blues scene in Brisbane, so if you're looking for 
							somewhere to dance each week then he is the man to talk to.<br><br>
							You may also see Brian behind a camera filming dance related videos such as the 
							"Empire Swings Back - Cake Song" music video, which placed 2nd at the Jazz Dance 
							Film Fest 2014 in Seattle.<br><br>
							Brian is always excited to talk about anything dance related so if you see him 
							around don't hesitate to introduce yourself and have a chat. If you have any 
							questions or are interested in taking a private with Brian, he can be contacted 
							by emailing <a href="mailto: brian@dancetheblues.com.au">brian@dancetheblues.com.au</a> or can be seen teaching regular Blues classes 
							in South Brisbane on Thursday nights.

							<p>Sheryl started dancing in 2013 with twenties Charleston and decided she wanted ALL 
							the dancing! Within six months she was both leading and following, dancing Lindy Hop,
							Balboa and Blues (or at least attempting to!). At this time she wanted more so she 
							attended her first blues exchange in Melbourne and has since then attended various 
							exchanges and workshops around Australia from local and international teachers.<br><br>
							Outside of dance, Sheryl is a mum of two and is passionate about design. You may even 
							see her custom painted dance shoes being worn at Swing Shack, or an illustration of 
							hers being used on flyers for an exchange.<br><br>
							Sheryl's main passion is Blues, although Balboa comes a pretty close second. You'll 
							see her around at lives blues gigs, behind the DJ booth playing her favorite blues 
							tunes and teaching regular blues classes in South Brisbane. You may even see her 
							performing with the Cats Meow solo troupe.<br><br>
							Sheryl wants everyone to have as much fun and feel as welcomed as she did, so she 
							has a strong focus on building the swing dance community feel in Brisbane. She 
							regularly organises the swing picnics and loves to hear people's ideas about our 
							community. If you ever want to talk about social events or ask Sheryl for a dance, 
							please don't hesitate to come talk to her (especially if you are new!).<br><br>
							If you have any questions or are interested in taking a private with Sheryl, she can be contacted 
							by emailing <a href="mailto:sheryl@dancetheblues.com.au">sheryl@dancetheblues.com.au</a> or can be seen teaching regular Blues classes

							<p>Marcel first stepped into a dance class in 2008, when he decided he needed some extracurricular activity
							to distract him from his engineering degree. As luck would have it, he happened to step into an Argentine tango
							class, and he was nigh on instantly hooked. His love of tango has lead him to travel as far as Buenos Aires, Argentina, 
							where he learned from some of the best tango dancers in the world. In 2011 Marcel started Swing dancing, and this
							eventually lead him to find Blues dancing.<br><br>
							Marcel's love of Blues dancing was born one rainy night in 2012 when, in a small church hall filled with the music of BB King,
							he learned of the dance of the juke joints, where groggy rural workers danced away their troubles after a long week of back-breaking labour. 
							He loved how similar, yet different, this slow dance was to his beloved tango, and how it allowed him to easily express what he
							heard in the gorgeous music. Since then Marcel has travelled to many Blues exchanges, learning from some amazing blues teachers, and 
							(quietly) revelling in the awesome dancing to be had on packed dance floors, he has even been invited to teach tango-blues fusion
							interstate.<br><br>
							Spreading this love of Blues dancing, and growing the scene in Brisbane, has always been close to Marcel's heart,
							leading him organize the first regular "rent parties" of Brisbane, which were instrumental in growing the number of
							blues dancers in the community.<br><br>
							Marcel loves to dance, so please don't hesitate to ask him for a spin around the dancefloor.
							If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, you can also email Marcel 
							via <a href="mailto:marcel@dancetheblues.com.au">marcel@dancetheblues.com.au</a>. Marcel also does privates, if you are 
							interested shoot through an email. To stay up to date about where Marcel 
							is teaching like us on Facebook. See you on the dancefloor!
