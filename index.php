						<p>The first records of blues music and dance were accounts around the 1890's
						in the Mississippi Delta region of the United States of America. It developed
						as a result of the significance of music in African American culture. The Blues
						was the music of the people; it was a form of expression or storytelling. Most
						people associate the blues with melancholy lyrics about loss or loneliness,
						but this was simply a reflection of the hardships faced by people of that time.
						Not all blues lyrics are steeped melancholy, as the famous blues composer and bassist
						Willie Dixon explains, "It's got to be a fact, or it wouldn't be blues."<br><br>
						Blues dance can be difficult to define because throughout the different
						states of the USA people were dancing different styles. One common theme
						was that Blues dance was a close intimate dance where people could express
						and relate to the music. It was only relatively recently that blues became
						more open and, by incorporating some other dance styles, an expressive and
						versatile dance.
